# Bristol Bay Red King Crab Collaborative Pot Sampling

## Project Overview and Goals
*[Text in development]*  
This project is a collaborative effort to ______, supported primarily by ADFG and NMFS and in collaboration with BSFRF and ABSC.  

The data from this project are public and shareable, and will continue to be updated through the yearly sampling repositories that are housed within this organization. The number of red king crab caught per pot (CPUE) during sampling used red king crab pots which were modified (smaller mesh, and escapes closed) for a controlled soak time (~30 hrs) so comparisons with red king crab fishery CPUEs are relative. Comparisons to NMFS summer trawl survey densities or distribution should note the substantial differences in methods, timing, and spatial coverage.
